Get a [Nexmo account](https://nexmo.com)\r\n2. Get a sms-enabled phone number and type it in the *config.js* file.\r\n3. Copy-paste the `APP_ID` or `KEY` and `APP_SECRET` available on the *API settings* on the config file.\r\n5. Configure the SMS settings for you number. The Callback URL should be *http://YOUR_HOSTNAME/v1/sms/in*\r\n\r\n### Slack integration\r\n1. Type your team name (like *NAME.slack.com*) in the config file.\r\n2. [Setup a slash command](https://lookies.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations) as a custom integration. This will let you reply with `/sms` :\r\n     * As URL use `http://YOUR_HOSTNAME/v1/hook`\r\n     * As command name use `/sms` or `reply`. `/s` is already the search command!\r\n\t * Check method is **POST**\r\n\t * You can copy-paste the command token in the *config.js* file\r\n\t * Use any custom, name, icon, label, description...\r\n3. [Create an API token](https://api.slack.com/web). This will enable our app to act on your behalf and create / post on channels.\r\n     * Set it for you team\r\n     * It should look like this `xoxp-ffff-ffffff-ffffff-fffffff`\r\n\r\n## Starting the app\r\n```bash\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\nYou should be live.\r\n\r\n## Contributors & Contributing\r\n- [Arthur Flam](https://twitter.com/ArthurFlam).
